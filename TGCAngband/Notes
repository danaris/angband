Mage:
	Spell speed: include casting speed and items that improve it
	Spell power: multipliers to spell damage & duration; gonna have to get funky with the formulae
	Roles: blaster Mage, buff/de buff Mage, any others?

Priest:
	Role: ??? Mind control?
	Gains some benefit from spell power, but less (mainly due to lack of blaster-ness)

Paladin:
	Role: Holy warrior, similar to priest (and paladin) role now
	Innate protection from evil at level ?
	Smiting?

Ranger:
	Role: ??? Buffing archer? Half-rogue?

Warrior:
	Rage?
	Look more at Barbarian, see what can be adapted well

More complex aggro: add ability for monsters to be hostile to each other, and/or friendly/neutral to you
This will make a Summoner role feasible, as well as MC-Priest, and animal companions for ranger
Probably requires fiendishly complicated changes to monster AI >_<
