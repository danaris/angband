# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must increase
# for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'T' is for the template (see monster_base.txt). This provides the
# default display symbol, some default flags, and the monster's pain messages.

# 'G' is for the display symbol. If present, this overrides the default display
# symbol from the template.

# 'C' is for color. There are 28 colors, as follows:
# d - 0  - Black
# w - 1  - White
# s - 2  - Slate
# o - 3  - Orange
# r - 4  - Red
# g - 5  - Green
# b - 6  - Blue
# u - 7  - Umber
# D - 8  - Light Dark
# W - 9  - Light Slate
# P - 10 - Light Purple
# y - 11 - yellow
# R - 12 - Light Red
# G - 13 - Light Green
# B - 14 - Light Blue
# U - 15 - Light Umber
# p - 16 - Purple
# v - 17 - Violet
# t - 18 - Teal
# m - 19 - Mud
# Y - 20 - Light Yellow
# i - 21 - Magenta-Pink
# T - 22 - Light Teal
# V - 23 - Light Violet
# I - 24 - Light Pink
# M - 25 - Mustard
# z - 26 - Blue Slate
# Z - 27 - Deep Light Blue

# currently unused: d, M, t, T

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and thus the
# monster will appear to be an empty black space if its color is "d".)

# Note to maintainers/devteam: Light Violet (V) is currently used for the
# "purple uniques" option. The option makes all uniques appear in this colour
# (instead of only Castamir and Waldern). It is therefore unwise to use it 
# for non-unique monsters.

# 'I' is for information--speed, health, vision in tens of feet, armor class,
# and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges from 0 (ever vigilant
# for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore intruders).

# 'power' is for power information--level, rarity, power, scaled power and
# experience for killing. The power and scaled power fields are determined
# algorithmically; if any changes are made to monsters, this file should be
# regenerated by running the game with the '-p' option.

# 'B' is for blows--method of attack, effect of attack, and damage from attack.
# There may be up to four of these lines; effect and damage are optional.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F: lines may be
# used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are separated by the
# '|' symbol.

# '-F' is for flags to remove from the template. For example, in 
# monster_base.txt, molds are given HURT_FIRE. We don't want the red mold 
# to have that, so we add a '-F:HURT_FIRE' line to subtract that flag.

# 'spell-freq' is for spell frequency - the number of monster turns, on
# average, before the monster will cast one of its spells.  This must not be
# zero. If it is 1, the monster will never move while the player
# is in sight, and will thus never attack in melee, as it will cast spells
# every turn: if the monster is to use a melee attack, then X must be 2 or
# greater.

# 'S' is for spell flags, which work just like regular flags.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed to
# describe the monster. Leading whitespace will be removed, and a single space
# will be added between D: lines.

# 'drop' lines create possible drops for specific monsters. If any L lines are
# present, the monster will drop *only* items from its L lines. Each item has
# its percent chance rolled for individually.

# 'drop-artifact' lines force a specific artifact to drop on death. Setting this
# on a non-UNIQUE monster is dangerous.

# friends lines specify options for what monsters can appear with other monsters
# on creation.  The format is.
# friends:Chance of friend appearing:number in xdy format:name of friend
# note that number is throttled depending on the dungeon level with only half 
# appearing at depth and the full complement 5 levels deeper.  All town friends
# will be divided by two.
# The code places monsters from bottom up and will not place it if it can't find
# room.  For best results, places the most important friends at the bottom.

# 'mimic' lines give item types that this monster may mimic. Each of the objects
# has an equal chance of being mimicked.

# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===

# UNIQUE monsters are just "special" monster races, with the requirement that
# only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is killed, it
# can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters are multi-hued--they change color, every player turn.
# Their base color is only used to set the initial color when they spawn.

# ATTR_FLICKER monsters are also multi-hued--but they only change between a
# small range of colors related to their defined color, and they start out
# as their defined color.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen is
# the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item that
# is lying on that floor. These monsters can currently be targetted as normal
# monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must KNOW the
# monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up and
# attack the player?)

# CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols of
# objects. They are in plain sight, but the character should not know that a
# monster is there. At the moment, such monsters can be targetted normally 
# (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this may change
# in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.

# (Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated as
# normal monsters that are just hard to see... if you (l)ook for them, you will
# find them unless they are invisible and you cannot see invisible, and if you
# use the * command for targetting mode you can pick them as a target.)

# TODO: Explain the other monster and spell flags. But maybe in another file.
